# AI Context and History

This directory stores information to help AI agents understand the project's evolution, current state, and future direction.

## Structure
- `history/`: Contains summaries of past work sessions and key milestones.
- `context/`: Contains architectural decisions, current system state, and mission-specific context.

## AI Instructions
1. **Read Before Starting**: Always check `AGENT.md` and the `.ai/` directory at the start of a session.
2. **Update After Work**: After completing a task or at the end of a session, create a new entry in `history/` summarizing what was done.
3. **Maintain Context**: If architectural decisions are made, update the relevant files in `context/`.
