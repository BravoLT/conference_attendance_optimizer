# Session 004: Presentation History Tracking Setup

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Goal**: Configure the project to track history specifically for a future presentation/talk and AI video generation.

## Changes
1. **Created `.presentation/` directory**: Dedicated space for presentation artifacts.
2. **Created `.presentation/history.md`**: Initialized the tracking file with a format guide and the first entry (this setup task).
3. **Updated `AGENT.md`**: Added a rule (`#5` under AI Guidelines) to ensure all future AI sessions log their work to `.presentation/history.md` with narrative and visual cues.

## Rationale
The user wants to generate a "view from the inside" documentary/talk about the creation of this project. Standard technical history is insufficient; we need narrative-driven entries. The AI toolchain will be used to generate the final media, so structured markdown is essential.
