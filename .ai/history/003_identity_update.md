# Session 003: Identity & Guidelines Update
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Agent**: Gemini

## Summary
Updated the project guidelines and file structure to correctly reflect my identity as **Gemini**. This involved renaming the main guidelines file and updating references across the project.

## Accomplishments
1. **Renamed Guidelines**: `CLAUDE.md` was renamed to `GEMINI.md`.
2. **Updated References**: All internal mentions of `CLAUDE.md` in `state.md`, `history/`, and PRDs were updated to `GEMINI.md`.
3. **Refined Identity**: Ensured project documentation acknowledges Gemini as the primary AI agent for this development session.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the Technical Stack selection.
- Begin implementation of Phase 2 as outlined in `PRD_001_initial_spec.md`.
