# Session 002: PRP Framework Adoption
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Agent**: Gemini

## Summary
Adopted the **PRP (Product Requirement Prompts) Framework** for agentic engineering. This session institutionalized a structured workflow for requirements, planning, and reporting within the `.ai/` directory.

## Accomplishments
1. **Framework Research**: Analyzed the PRP framework from `Wirasm/PRPs-agentic-eng`.
2. **Directory Structure**: Created `.ai/PRPs/` with specialized subdirectories for PRDs, Plans, Reports, Issues, and Reviews.
3. **Templates**: Established `prp_base.md` and `prp_planning.md` templates in `.ai/templates/`.
4. **Initial PRD**: Authored `PRD_001_initial_spec.md` synthesizing all requirements from `README.md`.
5. **Guidelines**: Created `GEMINI.md` and updated `AGENT.md` to document the PRP workflow and project-specific commands.
6. **Git Status**: Work is being performed on the `prp` branch.

## Next Steps
- Execute a plan to choose the Technical Stack (PRD Phase 2).
- Initialize the development environment and branch structure (Git Flow).
