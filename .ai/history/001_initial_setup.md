# Session 001: Project Kickoff & AI Initialization
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Agent**: Gemini

## Summary
Initialized the project's AI infrastructure. This session focused on setting up the governance files and directories that will allow me (and future agents) to work contextually on the **Conference Attendance Optimizer**.

## Accomplishments
1. **Analyzed README.md**: Extracted core requirements (Search, Matching, Scheduling, Logistics).
2. **Created AI Infrastructure**: Set up `.ai/` directory with `history/` and `context/` folders.
3. **Drafted AGENT.md**: Established rules for AI engagement, context maintenance, and workflow (Git Flow).
4. **Initial Context**: Created `state.md` and `decisions.md` to track current progress and architectural choices.

## Next Steps
- Define the technical stack (Frontend, Backend, Database).
- Initialize the Git Flow (create `develop` branch).
- Start designing the core data models (Employees, Conferences, Company).
